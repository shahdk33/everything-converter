# Everything Converter

## Description
this is a simple application that allows users to convert any metric to other metrics in one page. 

## Technologies
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

## Future Improvements
- I am considering creating a dropdown list to choose the first metric, and a dropdown list to choose which metric to convert to.
- Additionally, there is a lot of re-used code blocks with different metrics. Since most of the math is basically the same (just division or multiplication), I can simplify the code.
- Using API to fetch conversion rates as they are not static numbers.
