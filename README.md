# Everything Converter

## Description
this is a simple application that allows users to convert a given metric to other metrics in one page, made to practice basic frontend web development, web design, and responsive design.

I developed this application because I found myself constantly searching metric conversions on Google. Especially during COVID lockdown, I was shopping online from stores in the US and Europe. I also started baking a lot during my free time and was constantly converting ounces to grams for certain recipes, and searching for rate conversions for my online shopping. Making all of the common conversions in one page made it much easier for me to get the information I needed more efficiently.

## Future Improvements
- I am considering creating a dropdown list to choose the first metric, and a dropdown list to choose which metric to convert to for a cleaner UI
- Additionally, there is a lot of re-used code blocks with different metrics. Since most of the math is basically the same (just division or multiplication), I can simplify the code.
- Using API to fetch conversion rates as they are not static numbers.
